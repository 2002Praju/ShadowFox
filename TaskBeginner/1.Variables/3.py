#3. Store the principal amount, rate of interest, and time in
#different variables and then calculate the Simple Interest for 3
#years. Formula: Simple Interest = P x R x T / 100
P = float(input("Enter the principal amount"))
R = float(input("Enter the rate of interest"))
T = 18     #Time in months
SI = (P * R * T)/100
print(f"The simple interest is {SI}")
